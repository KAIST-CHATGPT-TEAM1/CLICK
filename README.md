# CLIcK:evaluation of Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence in Korean

The CLIcK is the dataset for evaluating cultural and linguistic intelligence in Korean. It is known that LLMs are not working well in low resourced language, including Korean. To emphasize these problems, it is needed to figure out where LLMs works good and where they donâ€™t in the view of culture and language. The CLIcK, which contains the well-categorized data from culture and language parts, can figure out those and find fine-grained limitations of LLMs in Korean.
