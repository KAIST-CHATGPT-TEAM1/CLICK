## Introduction 🎉

CLIcK (Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence in Korean) is a comprehensive dataset designed to evaluate cultural and linguistic intelligence in the context of Korean language models. In an era where diverse language models are continually emerging, there is a pressing need for robust evaluation datasets, especially for non-English languages like Korean. CLIcK fills this gap by providing a rich, well-categorized dataset focusing on both cultural and linguistic aspects, enabling a nuanced assessment of Korean language models.

## News 📰

- **[LREC-COLING]** Our paper introducing CLIcK has been accepted to LREC-COLING 2024!🎉
- **[3/20]** We revise some grammatical errors in the dataset. Test with the new version of CLIcK!
  
## Dataset Description 📊

The CLIcK benchmark comprises two broad categories: Culture and Language, which are further divided into 11 fine-grained subcategories.

### Categories 📂

- **Language** 🗣️
  - Textual Knowledge
  - Grammatical Knowledge
  - Functional Knowledge

- **Culture** 🌍
  - Korean Society
  - Korean Tradition
  - Korean Politics
  - Korean Economy
  - Korean Law
  - Korean History
  - Korean Geography
  - Korean Popular Culture (K-Pop)


### Construction 🏗️

CLIcK was developed using two human-centric approaches:

1. Reclassification of **official and well-designed exam data** into our defined categories.
2. Generation of questions using ChatGPT, based on **official educational materials** from the Korean Ministry of Justice, followed by our own validation process.

### Structure 🏛️

The dataset is organized as follows, with each subcategory containing relevant JSON files:

```
